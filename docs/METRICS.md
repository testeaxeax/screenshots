## Firefox Screenshots Metrics

*Last Update: 2017-11-06*

This document is a summary of the metrics Firefox Screenshots will record, how we're recording them, and what we're looking for in those metrics.  There are two main areas we'll look at:

0. Metrics to tell us if Firefox Screenshots is affecting Firefox.  For instance, do Firefox Screenshots users engage longer with Firefox?

0. Help us understand how people use Firefox Screenshots, so that we can improve the experience of the tool itself.  A/B tests fall under this umbrella.

Additionally, it's important to recognize that Firefox Screenshots is an add-on in a browser as well as a server-side service.

## deviceId / user ID

Each device that uses Screenshots (browser, profile, computer) generates a random UUID ID.  We call this the deviceId.  In addition a random secret is generated.  The two together are used to register and authenticate with the server.

The deviceId is only registered with the screenshots.firefox.com server when the user first saves a shot.  Starting Screenshots or downloading does not cause registration.

Each event is sent to the server with its deviceId.  The server hashes this ID (combining it with a random server string that is rotated occasionally) before sending it to Google Analytics.  This hashed ID is generally called `cid` (customer ID, a Google Analytics term).

For web page views (viewing and interacting with individual shots or My Shots) we serve up `/ga-activation.js` or `/ga-activation-hashed.js` (the latter for pages with private URLs).  This file is generated *per user* and includes the `cid`, if the user is authenticated with the service.

The deviceId does not change for the life of a browser profile.

### Key Metrics

Key metrics of Firefox Screenshots are fairly simple:

#### Do Screenshots users tend to use Firefox more?

Unlike the rest of the metrics, answering this question requires using Mozilla's Telemetry system, which tracks usage for Firefox as a whole. In order to compare engagement between Firefox sessions that do and don't have Screenshots usage, three scalars were added to the main Telemetry ping:

- `screenshots.download` - incremented each time a shot is created & downloaded during a session
- `screenshots.upload` - incremented each time a shot is created & uploaded to the screenshots server during a session
- `screenshots.copy` - incremented each time a shot is created & copied straight to the clipboard without downloading or uploading

#### Do people continue to create shots?

This will be tracked in a cohort graph.

#### Do people share those shots with other people?

In this case there is not a "right" answer, but sharing indicates a different kind of use case from personal storage.

We can look at the share event in GA, and we can look at non-owner visits (`web/visit/non-owner` vs `web/visit/owner`).  We also have some referrer access via GA.  These reports should be accessible within GA given the metrics listed below.

#### Do people revisit their own shots?

This is primarily a count of `web/visit/owner`.  The tool always opens the page once, and will fire `web/visit/owner-first` on that first visit.

#### Do people who view a shot, install Firefox Screenshots?

We will be tracking some events under `goto-pageshot` that would lead people from shot pages to a place where they could load the page.  Then we track clicking the install link itself, which GA reporting should be able to connect to the original `goto-pageshot` event.  We can't detect how often that install click leads to an actual install.

### Data Collection

Firefox Screenshots assigns each user a random ID (associated with their profile) when the add-on is installed. This ID is associated with all shots the user makes.  For the purpose of Google Analytics (GA) the ID is hashed. The same hashed ID is used for website visits and events, and for add-on events.

No metrics data is sent to any servers until a user interacts with Firefox Screenshots.

The add-on does not communicate directly with GA, instead it POSTs an event to the Firefox Screenshots server which, in turn, sends the event to GA.  This model allows us to only send the data we need for analysis instead of the more comprehensive data collection that google-analytics.js does.  Besides the event information specified below we also send the User-Agent string, and the add-on provides:
* Any A/B tests the user is in, or if the user is in the control for a test
* The application (“firefox”)
* The add-on version (“6.0.0”)
* For selections we send the size of the selection, rounded to 10 pixels.  E.g., 500 x 150

### Metrics schema

Each item in these events requires:

Event category: maps to the "source": `addon` or `web`

Event action: what the event "does", such as `start-shot` (note that Save actually "takes" the shot, the focus should be on what happens as a result of interacting with the control)

Event label: exactly what control invoked the action, such as toolbar-button.  These are the "locations":

* `toolbar`: the browser toolbar
* `topbar`: the top bar on the page during selection
* `overlay`: the question overlay after you click the toolbar button
* `navbar`: the top navigation bar on a shot page
* `content`: the non-navigation-bar parts of a shot page
* `myshots`: the shot index page
* `selection`: anything that happens during the selection phase, that doesn't happen in the topbar
* `keyboard`: any keyboard shortcut used

#### A/B tests

##### (finished) Highlight shot button

As described in [#2081](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2081) we are putting a badge on the button of some users.  The test is named `highlightButtonOnInstall`.

The dimension `cd3` will be `control` (no badge) or `badge` (10% of population).

If the badge is shown we send the event `addon/ab-highlight-button-shown` – this is marked as a non-interactive event.

##### (finished) Adjust My Shots button display

As described in [#2082](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2082) we are changing how the My Shots button is displayed.  The test is named `styleMyShotsButton`.

The dimension `cd4` will be `control` (normal styling) or something else Yet To Be Determined.

##### (finished) Auto-open share panel

As described in [#2079](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2079) we auto-open the share panel for a set of users.  The test is named `autoOpenSharePanel`.

The dimension `cd5` *for the creator* will be `control` (no auto-opening) or `autoopen` (share panel will be auto-opened).  The dimension `cd6` will be `control` (no auto-opening *happened*) or `autoopen` (auto-open happened in the past at shot creation).

The primary change was in `server/src/pages/shot/share-buttons.js`

sendEvent("click-install-firefox-home", {useBeacon: true});

#### Add-on performance measurements

Performance measurements use the GA User Timings API, instead of the regular Event API.

##### User Timings schema

Each item in these events requires:

Timing category: maps to the "source": `addon` or `web`

Timing action: what kind of performance measure, currently just `perf-response-time`, which measures the "response" in the RAIL performance model: the time from a user interaction (like a button click) to a user-visible change in the UI.

Timing variable: which event's performance is being measured. This generally is the same as the name of the event used to start the measurement, such as `start-shot`.

Timing value: the number of milliseconds associated with the variable. For `perf-response-time`, the response time in milliseconds.

##### Internal-only events

Internal-only events are used to help measure user timings, but aren't useful to record on their own.

*NOTE: Internal-only events are not submitted to GA.*

1. [x] New tab opened for newly-created shot page `addon/internal/open-shot-tab`
1. [x] Screenshots UI hidden by uicontrol `addon/internal/deactivate`
1. [x] Pre-selection iframe shown `addon/internal/unhide-preselection-frame`
1. [x] Selection iframe shown `addon/internal/unhide-selection-frame`
1. [x] Preview iframe shown `addon/internal/unhide-preview-frame`

##### First step: starting the shot

1. [x] Time from clicking the page action (or toolbar button) to displaying the preselection iframe, `addon/perf-response-time/page-action`
  - Start: `addon/start-shot/toolbar-button`
  - End: `addon/internal/unhide-preselection-frame`
1. [x] Time from clicking the context menu item to displaying the preselection iframe, `addon/perf-response-time/context-menu`
  - Start: `addon/start-shot/context-menu`
  - End: `addon/internal/unhide-preselection-frame`

##### Second step: choosing the shot contents

1. [x] Time from initiating a selection on screen to seeing the selection, `addon/perf-response-time/make-selection`
  - Start: `addon/make-selection`
  - End: `addon/internal/unhide-selection-frame`
1. [x] Time from clicking the 'full page' button to displaying the preview iframe, `addon/perf-response-time/capture-full-page`
  - Start: `addon/capture-full-page`
  - End: `addon/internal/unhide-preview-frame`
1. [x] Time from clicking the 'save visible' button to displaying the preview iframe, `addon/perf-response-time/capture-visible`
  - Start: `addon/capture-visible`
  - End: `addon/internal/unhide-preview-frame`

##### Third step: upload or download

For uploads, the measurement is from clicking the save button to a new tab being opened:

1. [x] Save a selection shot (Enter key or button click), `addon/perf-response-time/save-shot`
  - Start: `addon/save-shot`
  - End: `addon/internal/open-shot-tab`
1. [x] Save a full page shot, `addon/perf-response-time/save-full-page`
  - Start: `addon/save-full-page`
  - End: `addon/internal/open-shot-tab`
1. [x] Save a truncated full page shot, `addon/perf-response-time/save-full-page-truncated`
  - Start: `addon/save-full-page-truncated`
  - End: `addon/internal/open-shot-tab`
1. [x] Save a visible selection shot, `addon/perf-response-time/save-visible`
  - Start: `addon/save-visible`
  - End: `addon/internal/open-shot-tab`

For downloads, because Firefox doesn't always show download UI, the measurement is from clicking the download button to the screenshots UI being hidden:

1. [x] Download a selection shot, `addon/perf-response-time/download-shot`
  - Start: `addon/download-shot`
  - End: `addon/internal/deactivate`
1. [x] Download a full page shot, `addon/perf-response-time/download-full-page`

  - End: `addon/internal/deactivate`
1. [x] Download a truncated full page shot, `addon/perf-response-time/download-full-page-truncated`
  - Start: `addon/download-full-page-truncated`
  - End: `addon/internal/deactivate`
1. [x] Download a visible selection shot, `addon/perf-response-time/download-visible`

#### General Google Analytics information

This is stuff we get from including ga.js on Screenshots pages.

1. Browser type
2. Location
3. Language
4. Referrals
5. Social referral
6. Search terms
7. Demographic guesses about users
8. See if some pages are "visited" particularly often (we don't have access to the actual page, but can identify that some specific page has a large number of visits)

### Database Metrics

We can do queries directly on the database of Firefox Screenshots.  These might include:

1. Look at cohorts of individuals, reviewing their shot creation patterns
2. How many people make a couple shots?  How many make a lot of shots?
3. See if people are making shots of mostly private or mostly public pages
4. Identify the dimensions of shots
5. Compare shot URLs to a domain allowlist, to determine broad categories of sites that are popular to view

### Error reporting

In order to detect errors in the field that we haven't encountered in development, we catch and report most unexpected exceptions.  These exceptions are sent to a Mozilla-hosted server that aggregates and reports on these errors.  The development team monitors these errors.

In most cases if an exception report has been sent you will also see a popup notification of an error in Screenshots.  Exceptions use [catcher.unhandled](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/search?q=catcher.unhandled) or [noPopup](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/search?q=noPopup), and these are typically unusual cases where a popup would intrude on an otherwise recoverable error.

In addition to the exception message and a stack trace, the error information includes information about your browser (User-Agent), platform, the add-on version, and IP address.  We use [Raven.js](https://docs.sentry.io/clients/javascript/) to collect the error reports.

If an exception occurs in the context of screenshotting a specific page, we specifically filter out any reference to the URL or domain of that page.

Error reporting in the add-on can be opted out of in the same way as other metrics (using the general Telemetry preference, see below).  Error reporting on the website cannot be opted out of.

#### Error reporting data

The data collected in error reports includes:

* Date of the submission
* Browser version and User-Agent header
* Operating system
* The Screenshots system add-on version
* The exception message
* The stack trace
* Length of time the add-on was activated
* Exception-specific properties (for example, if there is an error connecting to the server, we add the server response code to the exception)

While the URL of the page you are shooting is not part of this information, we additionally filter out the URL in case of some bug in how we collect this information.

### Opt-out

The add-on reads the opt-out preference (`datareporting.healthreport.uploadEnabled`), labelled "Enable Health Report" in preferences under Privacy and Security.  If this preference is false, or if there is any issue trying to fetch the preference, then no data is sent.

The website reads the [Do Not Track Header](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/dnt/) (`navigator.doNotTrack`) and if it is present and set to *1* the website will not send metrics data.  We treat error reporting differently, and it is sent regardless of the Do Not Track setting.

There may be some exceptions to the above for debugging or analysis of malfunctions.
