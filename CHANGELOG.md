* put 50% of people into control ([#3723](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3723))This separates out people who are excluded from a test, from those who are in the control for the test. 50% of people always go to control, and 50% go into some experiment branch.

* Export NODE_ENV and NO_UGLIFY for make. ([#3643](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3643)) [4835366](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/4835366)
* Set s-maxage for shared cache on shot images. ([#3591](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3591)) [76fe5b0](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/76fe5b0)
* Floor a potentially fractional image width. ([#3541](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3541)) [b58ccb7](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/b58ccb7)
* make Screenshots work with third party cookies disabled. This adds a second attempt to login to wantsauth logins, one that runs in sitehelper.js, and tries to get the cookie set on a request that appears to come from the content page itself. Note this does not firmly protect from the content page overwriting window.XMLHttpRequest and having the add-on use that object. Fixes [#3581](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3581) [ac75a0b](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/ac75a0b)
* Update many but not all npm packages to latest. ([#3588](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3588)) [18fc984](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/18fc984)
* Set cache expiration for shot images. ([#3591](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3591)) [380bcd1](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/380bcd1)
* Hide share button on mobile with media query. ([#3589](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3589)) [32d85be](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/32d85be)
* Handle share url opens in onClick. ([#3357](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3357)) [5d23902](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/5d23902)
* Fix pluralization by passing integer time diffs as numbers, not strings. The Localized fluent-react component doesn't coerce strings to numbers, so strings like "1" are mistakenly rendered using the default pluralization. Bug [#3495](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3495) is due to our use of the plural as the default (for example, see the 'timeDiffMinutesAgo' l10n key). Fixes [#3495](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3495) [3b0a99e](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/3b0a99e)
* Try to work around [bug 1406571](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1406571) [27084fe](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/27084fe)
* remove `.nsprc` file now that tough-cookie has been updated. As seen in [#3561](https://circleci.com/gh/mozilla-services/screenshots/3561), we had to temporarily disable nsp checks due to a potential vulnerability in tough-cookie. The request library has been updated to use the updated tough-cookie, and, thanks to loose version tracking, looks like the fix percolates up to all our deps. Fixes [#3532](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3532) [0b09f21](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/0b09f21)
* Run server unit tests with npm run test ([#3582](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3582)) (Note tests have broken when they weren't being run)
  * Fix l10n fallback tests. Fixes [#3372](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3372) Fixes [#3372](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3372) [3079086](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/3079086)
* Extend default resource expiration time to 30 days ([#3592](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3592)). This is relatively safe since we use commit-hash-based cache busters on URLs.. This fixes one of the last issues from [#3202](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3202) [fdff27d](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/fdff27d)
* Raven cleanups ([#3594](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3594))
  * When sending pageview events for direct image views, only send the referrer origin. This matches similar logic in ga-activation.js that also scrubs the referrer down to only the origin.
  * remove shot URLs from Sentry reports. This scrubs both shot URLs in referrers, as well as shot URLs from errors on the shot pages themselves. The paths are translated to /a-shot/redacted in this case. This also adds a req argument to captureRavenException, which adds request-specific information to error reports (something that sendRavenMessage already did). Fixes [#3483](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3483) [5d70330](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/5d70330)
* Fix: remove control characters from filenames (thanks [Rimas Misevičius](https://github.com/rmisev)!). This patch removes all control characters (0x00...0x1F) from filenames, not only `"\n\r\t"`. They are not allowed in Microsoft Windows file names, see: [this](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365247(VS.85).aspx#naming_conventions). And possibly in other systems: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filename#Reserved_characters_and_words [489ae41](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/489ae41)

## Version 22.0.0

This is primarily a server release. Some changes in the add-on have been ported to the 19.x.0 line.

### Server changes

* Update packages for nsp/regex checks [e761c7a](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/e761c7a)
* Update express dependency ([#3553](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3553)) [719bf05](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/719bf05)
* Add new clip type: fullPageTruncated. For [#2129](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2129) [aa97577](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/aa97577)
* Bug fix for [#3513](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3513), create proper extension for downloads ([#3543](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3543)). The clip object is used to inform the download filename, so we need to add a clip before generating the filename [966bc6c](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/966bc6c)

## Version 21.0.0

This is a server-only release.

### Server changes

* Fix twitter card image [2988649](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/2988649)
* Update Opengraph / Twitter cards [dc10d75](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/dc10d75)
* Use correct latest commit in `__version__` endpoint [2b7a703](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/2b7a703)
* Ignore the tough-cookie (https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/525) warning for now ([#3533](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3533)). Followup to undo this in [#3532](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3532) [c21f3d3](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/c21f3d3)
* separate banner image [b5a939e](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/b5a939e)
* Csrf refactor ([#3516](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3516))* server: default to using csrf protection middleware
  * server: combine csrf and csrfProtection middleware [6aafff2](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/6aafff2)
* Re-enable eslint-plugin-mozilla now that it is fixed. Fixes [#3450](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3450) [73d4077](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/73d4077)

## Version 20.0.0

Note: this is a server release

* Update favicon. Fixes [#3492](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3492) [7544e9f](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/7544e9f)
* Send unauth'd /shots to /#tourThis lets a user who accesses Screenshots from the Library, but has never authenticated or used Screenshots, get redirected to an onboarding tour. Fixes [#3493](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3493) [af473c3](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/af473c3)

## Version 19.2.0

Note: this is a Firefox export (not a server release). This is what is shipping in Firefox 57.

* Update translations (see [Bug 1406526](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1406526)).
* Remove code that checks for system-disabled pref ([#3554](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3554))
  Leave the branch/leaf checking code in place, both to minimize the size
  of the patch, and to make it easy to observe a self-hosting pref I'd
  like to add soon. Fixes [#3549](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3549) [1a6a619](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/1a6a619)
* Stop Screenshots in Private Browsing ([#3544](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3544)). bootstrap.js sends the tab ID with the Photon page action, but it doesn't have the complete set of information that the WebExtension tab object has. Fixes [#3491](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3491) [5b13917](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/5b13917)
* Remove `"` and `?` from filenames ([#3524](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3524))* remove " and ? from filenames


## Version 19.1.0

Note: this is a Firefox export (not a server release)

* Upload jpeg ([#3513](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3513))* Start [#220](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/220), allow JPEG uploads, and respect content-type for JPEG or PNG
  - use JPEG for large shots
  - Allows JPEGs on the server, both to pass content checks, and to make use of stored content-types (instead of assuming image/png).
  - Puts an clip.image.type into shot objects
  - Uses .jpg for filenames when appropriate
  - Adds a new buildSetting for controlling the cutoff when we use JPEG
  - If a PNG image is too large, tries to make a JPEG and substitutes if the JPEG is actually smaller
  - Refactor some data:-URL and blob conversion functions into their own module. Fixes [#220](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/220) [82139ed](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/82139ed)
* Bug fix for [#3513](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3513), create proper extension for downloads ([#3543](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3543)). The clip object is used to inform the download filename, so we need to add a clip before generating the filename [966bc6c](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/966bc6c)


## Version 19.0.0

Note: this is a Firefox export (not a server release)

### Add-on changes

* Remove Photon-related conditionals in tests [0b31d58](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/0b31d58)
* remove browserAction. This changes the add-on to require the Photon page action, with no fallback to a browserAction
  - Removes test for Photon (assumes it is present)
  - Removes bootstrap.js code that deletes the browserAction button
  - Removes webextension code references to browserAction
  - Removes Photon conditionals (i.e., assume it's always Photon)
  - Make 57a1 the minimum version for the webextension/install.rdf. Fixes [#3468](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3468) [d4c56ae](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/d4c56ae)
* Add setting to control binary or base64 upload. This adds `$SCREENSHOTS_UPLOAD_BINARY=true` to turn the feature on. Fixes [#3481](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3481) [92b0d53](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/92b0d53)
* Convert to semantic locale strings for the slides. The numeric locale ids have made reordering complicated [3d590fb](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/3d590fb)
* Avoid form uploads from being truncated. `FormData` was not creating correct request bodies for large images. This changes the code to manually construct the form upload. Fixes [#3472](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3472) [671b003](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/671b003)
* Put a guard around the exception stack rewriting [dbc4750](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/dbc4750)
* Revert "Remove the full page and save visible buttons from onboarding". This reverts commit 1887c38903ce91199f389a345095d6a0546004ac. [33bb5ff](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/33bb5ff)
* Add a new slide to the tour. This slide includes the pageAction interface instead of the old toolbar button. Fixes [#3442](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3442) [9f072c0](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/9f072c0) [2550449](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/2550449)
* Change slide image to match Photon-style in browser image. Fixes [#3443](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3443) [dbad266](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/dbad266)

### Server changes

Note: 19.0.0 isn't a server release

* Toggle different onboarding tour for FF 57+- For 57+, include the full screen / save visible step in the tour, for
  four steps overall. Also change the Get Started text and image to
  refer to a page action, not a toolbar button.
  - For 56- and non-FF browsers, show the three step tour and refer to the
  toolbar button.
  - Add some trivial model unit tests, to get that ball rolling. Fixes [#3444](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3444) [d07db41](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/d07db41)
* Add Mozilla.UITour call to homepage, for [#3411](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3411) ([#3449](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3449))* Add Mozilla.UITour call to homepage, for [#3411](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3411)

* Build production versions of bundles ([#3432](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3432)). This always builds bundles as a production build. envify and uglifyify should also help improve overall bundle sizes. Fixes [#2254](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2254) [2450dc7](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/2450dc7)
* Remove full domain from analytics ([#3431](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3431)). Fixes [#3393](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3393) [900f438](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/900f438)

* Ensure that `shots` is an array before calling `shots.map()` ([#3401](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3401)) [75df157](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/75df157)

* Fix FxA email display [e2fea61](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/e2fea61)

### Add-on changes

Note: in a coincidence of timing, 18.0.0 will be a server release, and an add-on/Firefox export release. See [Bug 1396060](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1396060)

* Run all add-on svg files through svgo [40b9fe0](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/40b9fe0)
* Fix icon appearance for Photon page action.  See [Bug 1395284](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1395284). Right now, the icon is too dark, so it doesn't match the appearance of the other Photon page actions. The problem is that the URI passed as the action's iconURL is a `file://` URI.  The Photon theme uses context-fill and context-fill-opacity in SVG in order to style SVG icons correctly, and SVG context painting is not supported for file `bootstrap.js` should pass a `moz-extension://` URI instead, which context painting does support, and which is what the WebExtension browser action toolbar button uses. Additionally, the icon SVG used by the Photon page action needs to be updated with fill-opacity="context-fill-opacity". [b246cb9](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/b246cb9)
* Add logging of unexpected clipboard state ([#3430](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3430))This logs cases when the passed-in text is empty, or the textarea select doesn't appear to work. Logs are sent to Sentry. Fixes [#3406](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3406) [10b7c0f](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/10b7c0f)
* Fixed next and prev buttons for rtl [5a08464](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/5a08464)
* Moved Save/Cancel buttons from right to left for rtl languages ([#3412](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3412)) [#3241](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3241) [115d6ed](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/115d6ed)
* Send image to server in binary [9c558ce](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/9c558ce)

## Version 17.0.0

Note: this is a server-only release.

* Simplify retrieval of My Shots data, hopefully speeding things up ([#3374](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3374)) [f11b478](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/f11b478)
* Separate page script from data [e7a014e](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/e7a014e)
* Update fluent-langneg to 0.1.0 ([#3370](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3370)) [0678b6a](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/0678b6a)
* Use English as default if Accept-Language header is missing or `*` ([#3367](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3367)). Fixes [#3231](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3231) [d8425c6](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/d8425c6)
* More server tests: ([#3363](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3363))
* Make bootstrap.js/jpm the default in run-addon ([#3362](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3362)). Fixes [#3345](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3345) [e9ffc05](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/e9ffc05)
* Add timing to all database queries. Timing is logged when it goes over a configurable limit. Locations are logged based on caller filename/position. Fixes [#3318](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3318) [c5b8f24](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/c5b8f24)
* Put image sizes in images table. Fixes [#3207](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3207) [f762797](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/f762797)

* Immediately exit when Firefox is exiting. Fixes [#3323](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3323) [916c353](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/916c353)

### From 13.0.0

* Replace the WebExtension browser action with a Photon page action. ([#3239](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3239))
  * Replace the WebExtension browser action with a Photon page action.
  This removes the browser action and adds a Photon page action,
  pursuant to https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1366041.
  Right now Photon page actions are unrelated to WebExtension page
  actions unfortunately, which means that this patch has to do most
  of its work in bootstrap.js.  The WebExtension part passes
  messages to bootstrap.js to handle clicks and update the action's
  title and icon as necessary.
  * Test fix: Replace the WebExtension browser action with a Photon page action.
  Fix the test for the previous commit.
  * Update SHOOTER_BUTTON_ID in test.js.
  * Use the Photon page action when supported, the WebExtension browser action when not.
  Extend the Photon-related port used between bootstrap.js and the
  WebExtension so that bootstrap.js can tell the WebExtension
  whether it's OK to use the Photon page action.  The WebExtension
  should not attempt to use the browser action when Photon is
  enabled because bootstrap.js will have removed the browser
  action's navbar button.
  Modify the test so that it checks the Photon page action when
  Photon is enabled and the browser action when it's not.
  * Fix the expected button label in test.js for the Photon page action.
  * Maybe fix PageActions eslint errors. [4396250](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/4396250)
* remove high DPI shot capture for full page [fde181d](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/fde181d)
* Sets background highlight width to 100% [aee88eb](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/aee88eb)

  * Suppress ui is not defined error. This isn't a real fix, but it keeps the popup from happening, while still reporting to Sentry (or reporting sometimes)
  * Avoid `filenameTitle is undefined`. Generally default to Screenshot for the title, for cases (like file urls) where even self.url is blank
  * Clarify in the logs when an error comes from Screenshots
  * Don't force selection when forcing onboarding, as site will trigger onboarding itself
  * avoid Invalid tab ID when an active tab is closed
  The code always tries to make the icon not-active, but one case when it tries is when the tab has been closed
  * suppress Missing host permission for the tab
  This is the expected error for about pages and other non-permitted pages. Fixes [#2968](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2968) Fixes [#2979](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2979) Fixes [#2983](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2983) Fixes [#2998](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2998) Fixes [#2990](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2990) Fixes [#2978](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2978) [2cec496](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/2cec496)
* Lazily load code into the background page. This takes a minimal approach, loading scripts using the script tag on the first button click. Also creates and intercepts the contextMenu action, and any incoming communication. Reads onboarding flag and changes icon as necessary. Fixes [#2843](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2843) [8f98579](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/8f98579)
* Update icon [aff4283](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/aff4283)
* Moves button (Download/Save/etc) position if not in viewport [0d025fc](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/0d025fc)
* don't give an error when document.body is missing. This notices and reports the specific element that is in the page, that isn't an HTML document

### Server changes

* Various fixes:
  * make sure contentOrigin isn't undefined in CSP header
  * avoid including README and .template files in zip
  * Fix 2767, make `update_manifest.py` resilient to a bad `manifest.json`. Also fix the logic that keeps the version always going up
  * validate backend argument for manifest
  * Fixes [#2963](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2963) [#2426](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2426) [#2679](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2679) [#2856](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2856) [#2941](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2941) [#2985](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2985) [#2967](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2967) [#2994](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2994) [#2647](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2647) [ede3337](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/ede3337)
* Update npm packages. Fixes [#2991](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2991) [c17f30b](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/c17f30b)
* Hide search [1441aa6](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/1441aa6)

* Normalize exception stack URLs to improve Sentry grouping. Each copy of Screenshots has a unique `moz-extension://` UUID URL. Replace that base URL with `resource://screenshots-addon` for better Sentry grouping. Use 'resource', not 'moz-extension', because raven-js can't parse stack traces with 'moz-extension' URLs (raven-js bug [#974](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/974)). Fixes [#2975](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2975) [90c31d6](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/90c31d6)
* Set limits in regexes [e34a871](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/e34a871)

* Fix select list [3b839e7](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/3b839e7)
* Add `web-ext --browser-console` so it always starts with the console open

## Version 9.0.0

* Handle a race condition when a shot page is loaded at startup ([#2962](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2962)). Fixes [#2958](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2958) [7637e1a](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/7637e1a)
* Make empty selections report an error. Previously they were creating empty `data:` URLs and causing server rejection. Fixes [#2957](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2957) [dbeb56d](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/dbeb56d)
* Make re-saving an image work. Change the Save button to not be disabled after the timeout. Remove any previous clip images if Save is invoked twice [3c2323d](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/3c2323d)
* fix sending errors to Sentry ([#2952](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2952)). This changes the DSNs to the private DSNs in new Sentry projects. Discussion of using a private DSN in [Bug 1369162](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1369162). WebExtension background pages do not have a referrer or origin on their requests, therefore we need authenticated endpoints. Fixes [#2920](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2920) [f94bdfd](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/f94bdfd)
* Unload uicontrol event handlers properly ([#2942](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2942)). Fixes [#2838](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2838) [2d064b7](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/2d064b7)
* Do not localize product name in the button label [48974c7](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/48974c7)
* Disable DOM text capture. Fixes [#2931](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2931) [d30ef08](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/d30ef08)
* Defer the migration until local registration info has been fetched ([#2934](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2934)). Fixes migration issues and haywire notification on startup. Fixes [#2919](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2919) Fixes [#2902](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2902) [1aa0b9e](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/1aa0b9e)
* better align RTL buttons [ee5f588](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/ee5f588)

* allow for EXTRA_CONTENT_ORIGIN ([#2950](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2950))This adds a new configuration, EXTRA_CONTENT_ORIGIN, which is added to the CSP. This is intended just for migrating the pageshot.net content origin. Fixes [#2933](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2933) [1b746f9](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/1b746f9)
* fix select list [d7a6159](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/d7a6159)

### Other changes

* Implement some small improvements to export_mc ([#2948](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2948)). Add `--no-commit` option, so you can preview the changes without causing a commit. Validate `--branch` or `--no-switch-branch` options. Make it valid Python 3 (and Python 2), even though we aren't using Python 3 [8f97a3c](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/8f97a3c)
* Update expected button label text in browser test [61b1d19](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/61b1d19)

* If the /creating tab is closed open a new tab instead of updating the nonexistent tab ([#2850](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2850)). Fixes [#2842](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2842) [ccb2397](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/ccb2397)

### Server

* Change console.* server messages to use mozlog ([#2858](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2858)). Fixes [#2177](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2177) [98df4ec](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/98df4ec)
* make protocol configurable with EXPECT_PROTOCOL=https ([#2864](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2864)). Fixes [#2734](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2734) [a9761b6](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/a9761b6)
* Fix shot index trash flicker ([#2872](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2872)) [238cc23](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/238cc23)

## Version 7.0.0

Destined for a server deploy, probably only a later version of the add-on will be imported into Firefox.

* Update documentation [ef69b80](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/ef69b80) [56d919a](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/56d919a) [709b3ee](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/709b3ee) [75c4ca4](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/75c4ca4)
* Stop updating the tab state on tab 'updated' eventRelocate the urlEnabled check to the button click handler, and show the unshootable page error if the url isn't enabled.
  * Removing the onUpdated handler and the many redundant setIcon calls will hopefully help fix performance issues currently preventing uplift into
  Firefox.
  * Fixes [#2824](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2824) [d830d9a](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/d830d9a)
* Do not update toolbar button state inside tab 'activated' event handler.  According to kmag, webextension buttons have per-tab state, so setting the button enabled or disabled on update should be enough. Updating the icon on tab activated may be causing performance issues. See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1361792 for details. Also remove tab.active check, so that non-active tabs can catch button updates (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1362234#c2) [f63b90e](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/f63b90e)
* Start WebExtension immediatelyStop waiting for the 'sessionstore-windows-restored' event before
  starting the WebExtension.
  See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1361792 for details. [81a567a](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/81a567a)
* Add dropshadow to icons for dark themes [cbfa406](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/cbfa406)
* Add a quiet parameter to watchFunction to match watchPromise ([#2795](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2795))
  Quiet the watchFunction calls in tabs.onUpdated and tabs.onActivated, that should never pop up a message [1add819](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/1add819)
* Set Sentry URL when exporting to m-c. Fixes [#2782](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2782) [576a9c8](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/576a9c8)

### Server changes:

* Add landing page UI [166e079](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/166e079)

* Remove robots.txt and replace with meta noindex making Twitter cards work again Invalidates [#2805](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2805). Fixes [#2806](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2806) Fixes [#2774](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2774) [1c6efd6](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/1c6efd6)
* Disable all active A/B tests. Fixes [#2796](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2796) [ddcb7fc](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/ddcb7fc) [0726fd0](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/0726fd0)
* Make clip image.onload resilient. This duplicates some of the React logic that shows the clip image when it loads, but will run even if the bundle doesn't load or there's other Javascript errors. Fixes [#2792](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2792) Fixes [#2651](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2651) [60adfea](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/60adfea)
* Allow JS to run even when ga-activation.js is suppressed. Fixes [#2790](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2790) [bf39dc4](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/bf39dc4)
* Send only referrer origin to GA. Fixes [#2717](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2717) [4883e11](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/4883e11)
* Fix email address. Fixes [#2791](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2791) [46915c5](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/46915c5)
* Extended direct-view event with ownership. closes [#2143](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2143) [0cc662c](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/0cc662c)
* Inline style/image on /#hello. Fixes [#2703](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2703) [97e75bb](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/97e75bb)
* Complete screenshots style refactor [4723a92](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/4723a92)
* Clarify how Do Not Track affects does not affect error reporting

## Version 6.6.2

Another version landing in the non-master latest-firefox-export branch.

* Stop updating the button icon when the tab is updated ([#2824](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2824))
* Also pull in updated icons that have already landed in master ([#2817](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2817))

## Version 6.6.1

* Correctly set Sentry URL when exporting to mozilla-central ([#2782](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2782))

This version includes two changes that addressed Talos performance regressions discussed in [https://bugzil.la/1361792](https://bugzil.la/1361792):

* Do not update toolbar button state inside tab 'activated' event handler ([#2800](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2800))
* Start the WebExtension immediately, instead of waiting for the 'sessionstore-windows-restored' event ([#2813](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2813))

Note also that these changes have been added to Firefox directly on top of the 6.6.0 release, not on top of current master; the divergence is tracked
by the `latest-firefox-export` branch.

## Version 6.6.0

* Change metrics preference to `datareporting.healthreport.uploadEnabled` ([#2785](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2785))
  This preference is enabled on all channels, while the previous preference (`toolkit.telemetry.enabled`) is not enabled on Release (but is enabled on Beta, etc). Fixes [#2783](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2783) [8820967](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/8820967)
* Add left/right keyboard shortcuts to onboarding slides [709d5b1](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/709d5b1)
* call `URL.revokeObjectURL()` after download completes ([#2777](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2777)). Fixes [#2776](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2776) [db8e708](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/db8e708)
* Fix the detection of shot pages for Screenshots button disabling/activation ([#2780](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2780)) [32d45bc](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/32d45bc)

## Version 6.5.0

(Note: this version was never released, all its changes are bundled in 6.6.0)

* Pixel-snap-icon [7c804b4](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/7c804b4)
* Fix testIfLoaded (used in onboarding) so it can see when a load is in progress ([#2762](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2762)) [c521008](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/c521008)
* Update dependencies [290b047](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/290b047)
* Improve the mochitest to wait for the button to appear before starting. Also use the mochitest config from the mozilla plugin to save specifying globals. ([#2759](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2759))
  * Correctly enable the mozilla plugin for ESLint [5c6733e](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/5c6733e)
* disable selection when mouseup is in the scroll area ([#2726](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2726)). Fixes [#2698](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2698) [9392fe3](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/9392fe3)
* don't cancel the shot process when the upload fails. Catch the particular request and connection errors that should not result in closing the selection, and do not tear down the selector in that case. Fixes [#2690](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2690) [88aae2d](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/88aae2d)
* Pass through .popupMessage and .errorCode through to selector when there's a callBackground error [481d149](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/481d149)
* Pass addon version through to Sentry [ab35db8](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/ab35db8)
* Add .popupMessage to connection failures in `takeshot`. Instantiate `fetch()` with two arguments to work around [Raven bug](https://github.com/getsentry/raven-js/issues/924). Fixes [#2751](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2751) [5ae1a43](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/5ae1a43)
* Fix TEST_FAIL_SOMETIMES, which now needs an explicit failed status [6db59b2](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/6db59b2)
* avoid error popups when selector is torn down during save. Also bind several modules so that catcher works even after `selectorLoader.unloadModules` has been called. Note that an error is still signaled when there is a premature teardown, but only to the console. Fixes [#2652](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2652) [002b3d5](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/002b3d5)
* Fix: Scales onboarding slides to fit smaller windows [2b97d18](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/2b97d18)

## Version 6.4.0

* Improve Selenium tests For CircleCI:
  - start server before starting Selenium tests
  - Make sure the pref for system-disabled is True before installing (to workaround [#2712](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2712)), and False before running tests
  - Make channel configurable via `$FIREFOX_CHANNEL` Allow the tester to keep the window open with `$NO_CLOSE`
  - Create a test that clicks the Screenshots button, skips onboarding, clicks Save Visible, and confirms a tab opens with a shot URL
  - Make driver instantiation, which includes installing the add-on, async and blocking on add-on installation.
  - Fixes [#2695](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2695) [54aa574](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/54aa574)
* Small Makefile improvements: Add `make bootstrap_zip` to build a zip that includes bootstrap.js;  Silence the messages from pontoon-to-webext; Clarify that `install.rdf` depends on `package.json` [d44f34a](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/d44f34a)
* 404 images from expired shots [cb27e40](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/cb27e40)
* manually dim toolbar button when disabledOn Windows and Linux, WebExtension toolbar buttons are not automatically dimmed when a button is disabled (bug 1204609). Fixes [#2708](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2708) [b1415f6](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/b1415f6)
* Shutdown the embedded webExtension when bootstrap is asked to shutdown ([#2712](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2712)) [9a23339](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/9a23339)
* Use Content-Disposition for downloading images [defb4b2](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/defb4b2)
* use JS to open terms and privacy links on clickThis workaround is required because of a bug with e10s handling of https URLs inside moz-extension pages. Fixes [#2699](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2699) [88a0ed6](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/88a0ed6)

* - Apply Mozilla ESLint style, and fix resulting issues. Fixes [#2365](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2365) [03ad681](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/03ad681)  [ac25801](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/ac25801)  [f493102](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/f493102)

* added load_test_exercise.py to circleci [9d42d8b](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/9d42d8b)
* Remove embedded web extension in install manifest. ([#2688](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2688)). This causes the embedded web extension to be parsed at startup, and triggers a race condition in existing Firefox code during startup on a clean profile between AddonManager and devtools code. Removing this is not an issue for Screenshots because it delays startup of the embedded web extension until "sessionstore-windows-restored" is observed anyway.  See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1356394 for more info. [2fa25c6](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/2fa25c6)

  so that we don't export empty l10n files as we just fallback to en-US. Fixes [#2642](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2642) [211dcf6](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/211dcf6)

## Version 6.1.0

* Change the mochitest to work with the system-disabled pref rather than the user facing pref. ([#2637](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/2637))
  This makes the test work better due to the fact the extension will be disabled in-tree via the system-disabled pref. [bf62e73](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/bf62e73)

* Combine `parent-helper.js` and

* Increase default period of time to check for
  deleted shots from 1 minute to 1 hour. Fixes [#1865](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/1865) [7589d5e](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/7589d5e)
* Add GA logging for any shots that are deleted

* Move the share panel and button entirely into its
  own component fix share panel alignment when extension
  notification banner is in place. Fixes [#1714](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/1714) Fixes [#1565](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/1565) [ab468fd](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/ab468fd)
* (v2.4) check before trying to call window.sendToChild,
  which is safely missing on most pages. Fixes [#1910](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/1910) [5333ae7](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/5333ae7)

  polling interval on refreshing metrics slightly randomized, so multiple
  workers don't pile on [8d61f00](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/8d61f00)
* send Raven report when metrics updating fails
  Allow REFRESH_METRICS_TIME to be 0, disabling the refresh. Fixes [#1946](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/1946) [e4da720](https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/e4da720)
